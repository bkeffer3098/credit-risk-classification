Credit Risk Classification Analysis


Analysis Purpose:
In this file I have trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression Model to classify loan candidates as a Healthy or High-Risk loan. The data set used tracks historic lening activity from peer-to-peer lending service compannies. 


Results:
- Overall the model displayed 99% accuracy
- For Healthy loan candidates there was 100% in both precision and recall
- For High-Risk candidates there was 87% precision and 89% recall
- The balanced accuracy score, which is the average f1 score from both target groups, is 94%
- The confusion matrix showed 18679 True Negatives, 80 False Positives, 67 False Negatives, and 558 True Positives


Summary:
Overall I think the logistic regression model does an exceptional job of classifying these loan candidates. This model would be my recommendation for future loan cadidate assessments backed by the accuracy, precision, and recall shown above.
